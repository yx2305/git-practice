Body Systems
============
---
Fork the repository
-------------------

Forking is essentially _cloning_ a repository but all within Github. So instead of cloning a repo from Github to your local computer, you are cloning a repo from someone _elses_ Github account to _your_ account.

[Fork this repo: git-practice](https://github.com/jmk2142/git-practice)

This will clone _jmk2142/git-practice_ to your account. Since you have a cloned version on your account, you can manipulate it to your heart's content without worrying about my permissions.

---
Clone the forked repository (to your local)
-------------------------------------------
Using Github Desktop, clone the forked repository (now on your Github account) over to your local computer.

---
Create, edit, commit, and push your document to Github
------------------------------------------------------

1. On your local repository, inside folder **/body-systems**, create a new markdown document where your design notes will be published.
2. As a group, edit the document into markdown format to be shared on Github.
3. Once it's in good form, commit it and then push it back to your forked repository.

---
Making a _pull request_
-----------------------
* What is a pull request?
* We'll talk about this one together.
