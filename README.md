## Markdown
Markdown is a format of writing text where instead of tags (like HTML) you can quickly add formatting through the Markdown symbol rules. See markdown-examples.md

## Markdown preview in Atom
In atom, download and install a package called [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced)

This will allow you to work on markdown files in Atom and see the preview of the \*.md output side-by-side.
