# Headfirst Chapters 1 - 3

This is an exercise in __git__ as well as __javascript__.

## Instructions

1. If you haven't already, get a copy of my repository onto your local computer. There are two ways to do this.
	* If your group added collaborators to the forked repository you made in class on Wednesday, you can just *clone* that, as you have authentication on that repo.
	* If your group has NOT added you as a collaborator to their forked repo, that means you will either have to request collaborator access to that repo OR create your own forked version of my repository from [jmk2142/git-practice](https://github.com/jmk2142/git-practice).


2. On your local computer, create the following:
	* Inside folder __hf-one__, a javascript file named __yourUNI.js__
	* In this file, provide examples of three original Javascript functions.
		* They can do anything, think of it as practice.


3. Then, by the end of Sunday, make a __pull-request__ to me to add your sample file to the main (original / my) repository.


4. On Monday evening or Tuesday morning, check out [jmk2142/git-practice](https://github.com/jmk2142/git-practice) to see what kind of updates were made to the original repository.
	* You'll find you do not have all these new files.
	* This means your repository (a branch off the original) is behind several commits.


5. You can __merge__ those commits on my branch into yours (your repository) by syncing the repos in Git Desktop.

## Other Practice

You have some group "design docs" inside the body-systems folder. You could try practicing making edits to your group files and making commits.

One thing to think about though:

__What happens when two people pull repository data into their own local computers, independently make changes, and both try to push their works back to the GitHub repository?__

Example:

1. From *JIN* repository, file __jin-design__ on line 1 says `alpha`.
2. Two people pull this onto their respective local repositories; *JIN* to *JOHN* and *JIN* to *JANE*.
	* John edits `alpha` to `bravo` on *JOHN* repo.
	* Jane edits `alpha` to `charlie` on *JANE* repo.
3. John and Jane both try to push their changes back to the original *JIN* repository.

What happens in this case? (HINT: It's a problem - why do you think it's a problem?)
