                            <p>Normally an presidential candidate has most of these qualities, How many boxes did you check for Trump? You may realize Trump doesn't have many of these qualities. Then, what makes him stand out so that he could be elected as the president of United State? You probably would agree that he is a skilled salesman. But do you have any idea about what makes his often incoherent ideas so effective? We first need to know a few things about how ideas are designed to be more understandable, memorable, and thus more effective in changing people’s thought or behavior.</p>

  <h3>Compare the following two messages, and then answer the questions below:</h3>
  <div class="sitDescription"><p>The situation: Every algebra teacher in recorded history has had to deal with two student questions:"Why do I need to know this? When will I ever use this?" There two attempts to answer these questions.</p></div>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <ul class="sampleMess" style="list-style-type:circle">
      <h3>Statement 1</h3>
     <li>Algebra provides methods for moving from the specific to the general. It involves discovering the patterns among items in a set and developing the language needed to think about and communicate it to others.</li>
     <li>Algebra provides precedures for manipulating symbols to allow for understanding the world around us.</li>
     <li>Algebra provides a vehicle for understanding our world through mathematical models.</li>
     <li>Algebra is the science of variables. It enables us to deal with large bodies of data by identifying variables and by imposing or finding structures within the data.</li>
     <li>Algebra is the basic set of ideas and techniques for describing and reasoning about relations between variable quantities.</li>

        <h3>Statement 2 </h3>
      <li>My grade 9 students ask me when they are ever going to need this.I say,"Never. You will never use this."</li>
      <li>I then go on to remind them that people don't lift weights so that they will be prepared should, one day,someone knock them over on the street and lay a barbell across their chests. You lift weights so that you can knock over a defensive lineman, or carry your groceries or lift your grandchildren without being sore the next day. You do math exercises so that you can improve your ability to think logically, so that you can be a better lawyer, doctor, architect, prison warden or parent.</li>
      <li>MATH IS MENTAL WEIGHT TRAINING. It is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</li>

             <p>Although the first statement seems quite logical, any restless student probably would not jump on the algebra bandwagon after being told this message. As reasons for studying algebra, it won't work because of its abstractness and complexity. In contrast, the second message is a great response. The use of analogy and detailed discription makes the message simple and concrete: it's not that the future you're going to have a daily need to find the slope of a line; it's that your are making your brain more muscular. Also, the second message taps into your desire to succeed because it conveys the idea that learning algebra makes you realize more of your potential. <br><br>
               In short, messages that are <em>1) simple rather than complex, 2) concrete rather than abstract, and 3) appealing to people's emotion rather than their logic</em> are more likely to exert influence on people's thought and behavior. Please be sure to memorize these three techniques. You will need to apply them in later tasks.

    <p>TRUMP: <br>

Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn’t want to use a couple of words, and that’s <kbd>law and order</kbd>. And we need <kbd>law and order</kbd>. If we don’t have it, we’re not going to have a country. <br><br>

And when I look at what’s going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what’s going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it’s — I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long — we need <kbd>law and order</kbd> in our country.<br><br>

I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just — just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very — I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.<br>

We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are <code>living in hell</code> because it’s so <code>dangerous</code>. You walk down the street, <code>you get shot</code>.<br><br>

In Chicago, they’ve had <code>thousands of shootings</code>, thousands since January 1st. <code>Thousands of shootings</code>. And I’m saying, where is this? Is this a <code>war-torn country</code>? What are we doing? And we have to stop the  <code>violence</code>. We have to bring back <kbd>law and order</kbd>. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been <code>killed</code>, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been <code>killed</code> since Barack Obama became president, over — almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been <code>killed</code>. We have to bring back <kbd>law and order</kbd>.<br><br>

Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you <kbd>take the gun away from criminals</kbd> that shouldn’t be having it.<br><br>

We have <code>gangs roaming the street</code>. And in many cases, they’re illegally here, illegal immigrants. And <kbd>they have guns</kbd>. And  <code>they shoot people</code>. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.<br><br>

We have to be — we have to know what we’re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are <code>afraid</code> to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being <code>decimated by crime, decimated</code>.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>CLINTON:<br>
Well, you’re right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they’re treated in the criminal justice system. We’ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.<br><br>

And we’ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they’re well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.<br><br>

Right now, that’s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I’ve laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.<br><br>

But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we’ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.<br><br>

The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we’re seeing today.</p>
